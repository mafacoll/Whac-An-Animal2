<h1>WHAC-AN-ANIMAL</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this repo we've created a variation of the famous arcade game Whac-A-Mole, but we'll be using all diferent types of animals instead.

The game works the following way: an animal will pop on the screen and you'll need to whac (or click) on it. This will award you 10 points. Carefull though because every animal that you miss will deduct 20 points from your counter. If the counter reaches 0 the game will be over and the animal kingdom will have won. 
The animals will sense that you're winning and will send members of their army faster in an attempt to destroy you.
